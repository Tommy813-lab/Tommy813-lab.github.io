## What's Up
"I'm a self-taught cloud engineer in Largo, Florida, transitioning from 9 months of intensive AWS/Terraform study into my first professional cloud role."

 I started teaching myself AWS and Terraform. No bootcamp, no degreeâ€”just AWS docs, YouTube, and a lot of late nights after the kids go to bed.

I built the projects below to prove I can actually do this work. They're all real, they all run, and I'm paying for them out of my own pocket (though AWS free tier helps a lot).

Looking for Cloud Support Engineer roles, preferably remote, $60-80K range to start.

## Projects I've Built

### S3 + CloudFront Static Site Hosting
**[GitHub](https://github.com/Tommy813-lab/s3-cloudfront-secure-static-site)**

Built this portfolio site using S3 for storage and CloudFront for global delivery. S3 bucket is private, everything goes through CloudFront's CDN.

- HTTPS enforced with ACM certificate
- Origin Access Control so S3 isn't publicly accessible
- Loads in under 200ms globally
- Costs about $0.50/month

This is the same setup companies use for high-traffic sites. Shows I can do more than just spin up an EC2 instance.

### Multi-Tier VPC Network Architecture
**[GitHub](https://github.com/Tommy813-lab/multi-tier-network-sim)**

Designed a three-tier network with public web servers, private app servers, and isolated database tier. All the routing, security groups, and NAT gateways you'd see in a real production environment.

- Public/private subnet design
- NAT gateways for private subnet internet access
- Security groups with least-privilege rules
- Fully automated with Terraform

Took me a while to get the routing tables right.

## Skills

**AWS**: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, SNS, CloudFront, ACM, Route 53, Security Groups, NAT Gateways

**Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (modules, state management, multi-environment setups)

**Monitoring**: CloudWatch (metrics, alarms, dashboards), SNS alerting, log analysis

**Networking**: VPC design, subnet segmentation, routing tables, network ACLs, security group configuration

**Security**: IAM policies (least privilege), bucket policies, HTTPS/TLS, Origin Access Control

**Other**: Bash scripting, AWS CLI, Git/GitHub, basic GitHub Actions

**Still Learning**: Python (working on it), Lambda functions, RDS operations

## What I'm After

I need a Cloud Support Engineer job. Remote preferred, but I'll relocate if the opportunity's right.

I'm targeting $60-80K to start, with room to grow as I gain experience and certifications.

I'm studying for my AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert. Should have it in the next 2-3 months.

---

## Why Hire Me

I don't have a CS degree. I didn't go to a bootcamp. I don't have professional cloud experience.

What I do have:
- Working AWS infrastructure I built myself
- 9 months of consistent self-teaching
- The ability to figure things out (nobody taught me Terraformâ€”I just read docs and broke things until they worked)
- Real motivation (I have three kids who need me to level up)
- Customer service experience (delivery drivers deal with people all day)

But I learn fast, I work hard, and I'm not going to waste your time or money. I need this to work.

---

## The Big Picture

Long-term, I'm working toward financial security for my familyâ€”stable income, savings, and eventually real estate investing for passive income.

Right now? I'm focused on getting my first cloud job, getting good at it, and building from there.

This career change is happening. I'm just looking for the company that's willing to give me a shot.

## If You're a Recruiter

Start with the monitoring projectâ€”it's the most relevant to Cloud Support Engineer work.

Check out the live portfolio site to see I can actually deploy infrastructure.

Read this README to understand who I am and why I'm doing this.

If any of this resonates, let's talk. I'm ready to interview and can start immediately.

---

## If You're a Hiring Manager

Everything here is real and deployable. Clone any repo and run `terraform plan` if you want to see the code.

I document everything because that's how I'd work on your team. Check my commit history to see how I learn and iterate.

I'm not the candidate with the pedigree. I'm the candidate who will show up every day, figure things out, and get better consistently.

## License

MIT License on all projects. Use them, learn from them, fork them. I don't care. 

The point is to help people see what I can do, and if it helps someone else learn, even better.
