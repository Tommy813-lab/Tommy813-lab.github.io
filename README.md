# Cloud Engineer Portfolio — Security by Design

Welcome to my GitHub Pages portfolio. This site is built to showcase my **cloud engineering projects, security-focused practices, and production-ready labs**.  
The portfolio highlights not just what I build, but *how I harden it* — because real cloud engineering is inseparable from security.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Modern cloud environments live or die by their **security posture**. My portfolio demonstrates:
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) that’s hardened from the first commit.  
- Observability and monitoring pipelines designed for reliability, not vanity metrics.  
- Incident response tooling that reduces panic and accelerates recovery.  
- A philosophy of **“production is security”** — deploy as if tomorrow brings the breach.

## 🔑 Featured Skills

- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, GCP, Azure (focus on IAM, network design, workload hardening)  
- **IaC & Automation:** Terraform, GitHub Actions, PowerShell, Bash, Python  
- **Observability:** Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana  
- **Security Angle:** Threat modeling, incident response playbooks, compliance guardrails (CIS, NIST)  
- **Production Mindset:** Reliability, scalability, disaster recovery, least privilege by default  

---

## 🚀 Projects (highlights)

- **Prod-Guard:** Opinionated Terraform modules with built-in security guardrails.  
- **CrashLens:** Crash capture and observability pipelines for cloud-native workloads.  
- **IR-Orchestra:** Automated incident response runbooks with human-in-the-loop confirmation.  
- **Proactive Network Monitoring:** Real-time visibility and anomaly detection for cloud infra.  

Each project repo is linked and documented with both **deployment instructions** and **security considerations**.

## 🌐 Deployment

This portfolio is live via **GitHub Pages**.  

**To deploy your own version:**
1. Fork or clone the repo.  
2. Place your site files into `/docs`.  
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**, set branch = `main`, folder = `/docs`.  
4. Save. Your portfolio is live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.  

Optional: Add a `CNAME` file for a custom domain and configure HTTPS.

## 📊 Production-Readiness

This repo is treated like any other production deployment:  
- **Version controlled** with branches/PRs for updates.  
- **Accessible and mobile-first design** for wide usability.  
- **Security-conscious**: no external JS/CDN dependencies; minimal attack surface.  
- **Audited** with Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, and best practices.
