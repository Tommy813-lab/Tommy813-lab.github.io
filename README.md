## TL;DR  
One-stop portfolio that maps my hands-on AWS & Terraform builds to real-world cert domains and shows you exactly what I built, how it works, and why it matters.

**Tech Stack:** Terraform ¬∑ AWS (S3, EC2, IAM, VPC, CloudFront, CloudWatch, SNS) ¬∑ GitHub Pages ¬∑ CI/CD  
**Highlights:** Modular, deployable infrastructure, cert-aligned projects, clean documentation, real infra skills.

## What You‚Äôll See
- **Featured Projects** ‚Äî Clickable links to live or deployable repos (web app, static site, monitoring, network sim)  
- **AWS Cert Mapping** ‚Äî Each project is mapped to AWS certification domains (ex: Solutions Architect, SysOps, Developer)  
- **Tools & Tech** ‚Äî Every build here uses cloud-native tools; nothing ‚Äújust for show.‚Äù  
- **Live Site** ‚Äî This repo powers the site you‚Äôre on ‚Äî showing I can build & deploy in real life.

## Why This Portfolio Matters
Recruiters and engineers can instantly see:
- **What I build**, not just what I say  
- **How these projects interlock** (certification-aligned)  
- **Deployable infrastructure**, not just diagrams  
- **Clean presentation**, reducing friction for evaluation

## About Me
I build fast, iterate often, and align every piece of my portfolio with what hiring teams want to see. This is not a ‚Äúshow,‚Äù it‚Äôs infrastructure I stand behind.

# Tommy813 Cloud Portfolio üöÄ

Welcome to my live cloud lab ‚Äî a collection of hands-on builds aligned with AWS cert domains and SRE principles. Every project here is deployable, cert-mapped, and built from scratch to showcase real infrastructure skills.

## üîß Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [ec2-webapp-with-s3-backend](projects/ec2-webapp-with-s3-backend/README.md) | Hybrid web app with EC2 frontend and S3 backend, IAM-secured |
| [s3-cloudfront-secure-static-site](projects/s3-cloudfront-secure-static-site/README.md) | Static site hosted via S3 + CloudFront with OAI and HTTPS |
| [Proactive-monitoring-with-cloudwatch-sns](projects/Proactive-monitoring-with-cloudwatch-sns/README.md) | CloudWatch alarms triggering SNS alerts for proactive ops |
| [multi-tier-network-sim](projects/multi-tier-network-sim/README.md) | Simulated multi-tier VPC with public/private layers and routing |

## üìú AWS Cert Mapping

Each project maps directly to AWS cert domains:
- **Solutions Architect**: VPC design, EC2 provisioning, IAM roles
- **SysOps Admin**: Monitoring, alerting, automation
- **Developer Associate**: Serverless, S3 hosting, event-driven flows

See [docs/cert-mapping.md](docs/cert-mapping.md) for detailed alignment.

## üõ† Tools Used

Terraform, PowerShell, GitHub Actions, AWS CLI, CloudWatch, Lambda, SNS, S3, EC2, IAM, CloudFront

## üåê Live Portfolio

This repo powers [Tommy813-lab.github.io](https://tommy813-lab.github.io) ‚Äî a browsable landing page linking to all builds and cert mapping.

## üß† About Me

I iterate fast, troubleshoot in real time, and build with recruiter optics in mind. Every folder here is modular, cert-aligned, and built to ship.
